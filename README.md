 "Animal & Hug" Project
1. My Prompts
Initial prompt: "Create a Python code for an animal shelter named 'Animal & Hug' using a JSON file. Use classes and English comments."

Improved/Specific prompts: "Make the JSON structure more complex," "Add a reason field for urgent pets," and "Add cat and dog ASCII images to the console and the database."

2. What surprised me
I was surprised that the AI could create visual art (ASCII art) using only text. I didn't think a simple console program could look like a "branded" application with cute animal faces. Also, I was shocked that the AI could store those "images" inside a JSON file using special symbols like \n.

3. What was extra
The AI suggested things I didn't even think about:

Adding a unique ID for every pet (e.g., HUG-12345).

Adding a timestamp (entry date) automatically.

The "Reason" field for SOS cases — it made the project feel like a real-life help tool, not just a school task.

Error Handling: It added a try/except block to make sure the program doesn't crash if I type a letter instead of a number for donations.

4. What I changed
In the first version, the code was a bit too simple, and the JSON file looked "boring." I asked to make the database structure deeper. Also, I noticed that if I didn't follow the steps correctly, I got errors (like KeyError), so I worked with the AI to add a "validation check" that repairs the database if it's outdated.

5. My experience
What felt easy: Adding emojis and changing the text was fun and simple.

What was confusing: At first, I was confused by how the program "talks" to the JSON file. I also got a bit scared when the program crashed because of my old data file.

What I learned: I learned how to work with JSON as a real database. I learned that coding is about logic and structure.

How AI helped me: The AI acted like a patient partner. It didn't just give me the code; it explained why each function is there

How I feel now: Before this, I was worried I wouldn't have anything to show. Now, I more very confident


HabitTracker
1. My Prompts
First version: "Create a habit tracker in Python that looks like me, with my favorite habits and emojis."
Improved version: "Add a JSON save system, calculate a 'Current Vibe' status based on percentage, and make the interface look pretty with heart symbols and aligned text."
2. What surprised me
I was surprised that the AI could understand my "personality" and suggest habits like Creative Procrastination or Name Mixing Paradox. It was also cool to see how the code can automatically generate a new list of tasks every day just by using the computer's clock (datetime).

3. What was extra
It explained why I need to save data to a JSON file so my progress doesn't disappear when I close the app.
4. What I changed
In the beginning, the habits were just a simple list. I changed them into a Dictionary so each habit could have its own emoji. I also modified the "mark habit" function because I wanted a special message to pop up when I complete my favorite habit (Sending Emojis).
5. My experience (The most important part)
What felt easy: Writing the habits and emojis. It was fun to customize the tracker to make it feel like "me."
What was confusing: Understanding how the program checks if the JSON file already exists. It took some time to realize that the file is only created the first time you save.
What I learned: I I  learned that JSON is a very powerful tool for storing information.
How AI helped me: It felt like brainstorming with a friend who knows a lot about coding. It helped me turn my messy ideas into a clean, working program.
How I feel now: I feel very proud, becauseI realized that programming isn't just for geniuses, also it’s a creative tool that anyone can use to build something personal and useful.
